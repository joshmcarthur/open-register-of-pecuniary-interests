          New Zealand elected officials are legally required to declare their financial interests publicly. Councils must maintain registers of their members' pecuniary interests under the Local Government Act 2002 (introduced November 2022), while Parliament maintains annual registers for MPs. These declarations include employment, shareholdings, property interests, gifts, and potential conflicts of interest. The legal framework promotes transparency, public trust, and helps citizens identify when elected officials may have competing financial interests in public decisions.
